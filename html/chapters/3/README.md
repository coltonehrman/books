## The Project at a Glance

Our project, the Personal Portfolio Website, will serve as a dynamic canvas for your growing web development skills. It's designed to be a practical, hands-on experience that not only teaches you the ins and outs of HTML and later CSS and JavaScript but also gives you a tangible asset that you can use in your professional life. Think of it as your digital calling card, a place where your work, skills, and passion for development come together to tell a compelling story about who you are as a developer.

## Starting with the Basics

With clarity on purpose, audience, content, and organization, you're ready to start coding. Begin with the basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Personal Web Portfolio</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

This template is your starting point, a container waiting to be filled with your creative and structured content based on the earlier reflections.

### `<title>`

The new `<title>` tag was introduced and is a special child of the `<head>` tag, which allows you to give your Website a title that is shown on your Browser's tab.

## Building the Foundation

The `<header>` & `<nav>` for your site's name and navigation. A compelling `<section>` for your hero area to introduce yourself. Then the `<footer>`, grounding your site with necessary information and links.

### Creating the Header & Navigation

```html
<header>
  <h1>Your Name</h1>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a>Home</a></li>
      <li><a>About Me</a></li>
      <li><a>Portfolio</a></li>
      <li><a>Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
```

#### `<header>`

The `<header>` tag can be used to indicate a Websites header information to the viewer. This should **not** be confused with the `<head>` tag, which is intended for the Browser, not the viewer.

Inside the `<header>` we can provide a site navigation with the `<nav>` tag to guide the viewer around our website via `<a>` tag links.

On every HTML page, there should only ever be 1 unique `<header>` tag used, similar to the `<footer>`.

#### `<nav>`

The `<nav>` tag can be used to indicate a Websites navigation links via `<a>` tags. The `<nav>` tag can typically be found inside a `<header>`, as traditionally the top part (aka `header`) of a Website would usually showcase navigation links to the viewer to click around the Website.

Inside the `<nav>` we can provide clickable links with the `<a>` tag that will navigate the viewer to a different part or section of the Website.

### Adding a Hero Section

```html
<section>
  <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>

    creating stunning and efficient web solutions. Explore my work and get in
