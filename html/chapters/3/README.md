# Chapter 3: Introducing our Personal Portfolio Project

Welcome to Chapter 3, a pivotal moment in your journey to becoming a proficient web developer. As we delve into this chapter, we stand at the threshold of turning our vision into realityâ€”starting with the foundation of your very own Personal Portfolio Website. This project isn't just about learning HTML; it's about creating a platform where you can showcase your skills, projects, and the journey you're embarking on as you progress through this book.

## The Project at a Glance

Our project, the Personal Portfolio Website, will serve as a dynamic canvas for your growing web development skills. It's designed to be a practical, hands-on experience that not only teaches you the ins and outs of HTML and later CSS and JavaScript but also gives you a tangible asset that you can use in your professional life. Think of it as your digital calling card, a place where your work, skills, and passion for development come together to tell a compelling story about who you are as a developer.

## Starting with the Basics

With clarity on purpose, audience, content, and organization, you're ready to start coding. Begin with the basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Personal Web Portfolio</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

This template is your starting point, a container waiting to be filled with your creative and structured content based on the earlier reflections.

### `<title>`

The new `<title>` tag was introduced and is a special child of the `<head>` tag, which allows you to give your Website a title that is shown on your Browser's tab.

## Building the Foundation

The `<header>` & `<nav>` for your site's name and navigation. A compelling `<section>` for your hero area to introduce yourself. Then the `<footer>`, grounding your site with necessary information and links.

_All the content we add will be nested inside the `<body>` tag._

### Creating the Header & Navigation

Our header is the top of the Web page and typically includes some site navigation elements in it to easily guide the viewer.

```html
<header>
  <h1>Colton Ehrman</h1>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a>Home</a></li>
      <li><a>About Me</a></li>
      <li><a>Portfolio</a></li>
      <li><a>Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
```

#### `<header>`

The `<header>` tag can be used to indicate a Websites header information to the viewer. This should **not** be confused with the `<head>` tag, which is intended for the Browser, not the viewer.

Inside the `<header>` we can provide a site navigation with the `<nav>` tag to guide the viewer around our website via `<a>` tag links.

On every HTML page, there should only ever be 1 unique `<header>` tag used, similar to the `<footer>`.

#### `<nav>`

The `<nav>` tag can be used to indicate a Websites navigation links via `<a>` tags. The `<nav>` tag can typically be found inside a `<header>`, as traditionally the top part (aka `header`) of a Website would usually showcase navigation links to the viewer to click around the Website.

Inside the `<nav>` we can provide clickable links with the `<a>` tag that will navigate the viewer to a different part or section of the Website.

#### `<a>`

The `<a>` tag is called the **anchor** tag is and is meant to _link_ to another web page, or section of a web page. It can be used an configured a couple different ways, and typically has an **href** attribute added to it. _We have not talked attributes yet, but will soon._

#### `<ul>`

The `<ul>` tag is called an **un-ordered list** tag is and is used when creating a bullet-list of items, sort of like a todo list. There is another type of list tag `<ol>` (aka **ordered list**) which is used when the list is ordered with something like numbers (ie: 1, 2, 3...).

When using either `<ul>` or `<ol>` tags, you will pair them with child elements of `<li>` for this individual items inside the list.

#### `<li>`

The `<li>` tag is called a **list item** and is nested inside a `<ul>` or `<ol>` for individual list items. Each `<li>` would wrap the content of the item that you want inside the list.

### Adding a Hero Section

Your first question may be, what is a "Hero" section? **Hero** is a common term used in Web design for the initial section that shows up when first viewing a Web page. The hero is what stands out and is the most prominent section of the whole page.

```html
<section>
  <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm Colton Ehrman, a passionate Software Engineer with a love for creating stunning and efficient web solutions. Explore my work and get in touch!</p>
</section>
```

#### `<section>`

The `<section>` tag is meant to wrap a particular section of a Web page and used to sort of group things together. _When it comes to styling, sections are useful to add specific styles to each section, or create common styling across all sections._

A good way to think about HTML is grouping things into boxes/sections and creating a hierarchical structure of parent->child elements for each area of the Web page.

The `<header>` and `<footer>` tags are specific "sections" of a Web page, where-as the `<section>` is more of a generic section and sandwiched in-between the `<header>` and `<footer>` elements.

Another generic tag for grouping things is the `<div>` tag, but this tag has no "semantic" value to it and is not preferred to use, and instead should work with semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<section>`.

#### `<h1>`

The `<h1>` tag is called **Heading One** and can be thought of as the biggest piece of text on the Web page.

There are other headings as well, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, and so on all the way to `<h6>`, which is the "smallest" heading tag.

Think of a heading as like a "headline" of a news article or blog.

You can have a single heading (like `<h1>`) as a title, and other headings throughout the page to indicate a new section of text.

#### `<p>`

The `<p>` tag is a **Paragraph** of text. I think the purpose of this is pretty self-explanatory. Defer to the article metaphor used with the **Heading** tags.

### Creating the Footer

Our footer is typically found at the very bottom of the Web page and can be used for a navigation, copyright statement, and social links.

```html
<footer>
  <p>&copy; 2024 Colton Ehrman. All rights reserved.</p>
  <p>Connect with me on <a>LinkedIn</a></p>
</footer>
```

#### `<footer>`

The `<footer>` tag is a semantic tag for wrapping the footing of a Web page.

#### `&copy;`

This is **not** a tag, but instead called an HTML symbol. Which are special "codes" that can be used to add something that is not a normal character such as `a` through `z`.

Symbols have different codes for different reasons, but when adding a symbol to an HTML page, you want to use the **HTML code** or **HTML entity**, which is prefixed with the `&` sign *(and the `#` sign if using an entity)* and suffixed with the `;` sign.

_The **code** for the same copyright symbol is `&#169;`. Which can be used interchangeably with `&copy;`. Just a matter of preference, but I prefer the **entity**._

### Putting it all Together

Now, let's put everything together into a single HTML code for the page.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Personal Web Portfolio</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Colton Ehrman</h1>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a>Home</a></li>
          <li><a>About Me</a></li>
          <li><a>Portfolio</a></li>
          <li><a>Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Colton Ehrman, a passionate Software Engineer with a love for creating stunning and efficient web solutions. Explore my work and get in touch!</p>
    </section>

    <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2024 Colton Ehrman. All rights reserved.</p>
      <p>Connect with me on <a>LinkedIn</a></p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```
