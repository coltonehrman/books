# HTML: Your Journey to Web Mastery

Welcome to the World of Web Development!

## Who am I?

My name is Colton Ehrman, and I will be your guide on this amazing journey of the Web.

As a fully self-taught software engineer, I've been immersed in the world of technology since I was 20 years old _(now 28)_ and have spent the last 7 years working as an engineer, with the most recent 3 years at PayPal. My expertise spans from the foundational aspects of web development to the complexities of advanced applications that require a team effort to conceive and execute. My proficiency isn't just limited to web development; I have a broad understanding of the technologies that support the web, including networking, security, and DevOps.

My comfort zone lies in strategizing web-related designs, from conceptualizing personal websites to developing frameworks for other engineers to build upon.

## Why am I writing this book?

The essence of this book is to distill all the knowledge and experience I've accumulated throughout my career into a single, comprehensive guide.

I'm driven by a passion for sharing knowledge and assisting others. It's my hope that this book will not only serve as a personal knowledge repository but also as a valuable resource for you.

Venturing into writing and sharing technical information presents a new challenge for me, one that extends beyond the daily technical hurdles and into the realm of educating others.

Ultimately, I envision this book as a testament to my expertise and a valuable addition to my professional portfolio, showcasing my depth of knowledge to potential collaborators.

In summary, my motivations are to:

1. Document and share my accumulated knowledge and experience.
1. Help others by providing accessible, valuable content.
1. Challenge myself with the art of technical writing.
1. Create a portfolio piece that reflects my expertise.

## What is HTML?

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create web pages. Every web page is made up of HTML, no matter how big or small. Think of it like the skeleton of a website â€“ it provides the structure and meaning by defining content as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more. But don't worry, we'll start from the very basics and build our way up.

### Is HTML a coding language?

This is a topic of debate. HTML is a markup language designed to instruct web browsers on displaying content. Whether it qualifies as a "coding" language depends on your perspective. It's a nuanced question, blending subjective views with objective criteria. I'll let you form your own opinion as we explore HTML together.

## Why Learn HTML?

HTML is an indispensable skill in web development, essential even for those who don't work directly with it. As the universal language of web browsers, a solid understanding of HTML is crucial for any web-related endeavor.

## Who is This Book For?

This book is crafted for anyone seeking to understand HTML, regardless of their background or skill level. Whether you're completely new to web development or looking to refresh your knowledge, you'll find value in these pages. If there's something specific you're curious about or a challenge you're facing, I encourage you to reach out. I'm here to help and possibly integrate your questions into the content.
